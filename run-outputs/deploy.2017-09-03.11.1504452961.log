Using /Users/hsutsungchun/ansible-kubeadm/ansible.cfg as config file
ERROR! the role 'reset' was not found in /Users/hsutsungchun/ansible-kubeadm/roles:/etc/ansible/roles:/Users/hsutsungchun/ansible-kubeadm

The error appears to have been in '/Users/hsutsungchun/ansible-kubeadm/reset.yaml': line 6, column 7, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

  roles:
    - reset
      ^ here
