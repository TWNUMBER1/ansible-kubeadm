Using /Users/hsutsungchun/ansible-kubeadm/ansible.cfg as config file
ERROR! 'retires' is not a valid attribute for a Task

The error appears to have been in '/Users/hsutsungchun/ansible-kubeadm/roles/master/tasks/main.yml': line 28, column 3, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:


- name: "sanity checkm, pods"
  ^ here
