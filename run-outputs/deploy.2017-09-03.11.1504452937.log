Using /Users/hsutsungchun/ansible-kubeadm/ansible.cfg as config file
ERROR! 'incluse' is not a valid attribute for a Play

The error appears to have been in '/Users/hsutsungchun/ansible-kubeadm/site.yml': line 2, column 3, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

---
- incluse: reset.yaml
  ^ here
